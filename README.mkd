# ASPerge

Web service generator for ASP-based management.


## Pages

### /
The index contains a description, and link to other pages.

### /user
Allow for user to select its name.

### /user/<userid>
Allow for user to indicate its choice(s).

### /compilation
If configuration said so, it's the access to that page that provoke the compilation of models.

### /results
The representation of given models.

### /overview
The current choices of all users.

### /configuration
Access to the full json configuration, if allowed by the said configuration.

### /configuration/raw
Access to the input json configuration, if allowed by the said configuration.




## Example

A web service to assign a character to each player.

Input base encoding:

    1{ play(H, P): charc(P), ok(H,P) } 1 :- human(H).
    1{ play(H, P): human(H), ok(H,P) } 1 :- charc(P).

Note that ok/2 atoms are expected for the program to behave normally, as well as `charc/1` and `human/1`. They will all be derived from the configuration.

Now, define in configuration what are the choices:


    "base encoding": ...,        # see above
    "shows": "play/2",
    "engine": "ASP/clingo",

    "users options": {
        "user type": "restricted",
        "allowed users": {
            "Pierre": "p",
            "David": "d",
            "Noémie": "n",
            "Noa": "v"
        }
    },
    "choices options": {
        "default": "all",
        "type": "multiple choice",
        "choices": {
            "Méléas": "m",
            "Éléa": "e",
            "Haringer": "h",
            "Ina": "i"
        },
        "data atoms": [
            "human({user}",
            "charc({choice}"
        ],
        "produced atoms": "ok({user},{choice})"
    },
    "output options": {
        "max models": 10,
        "sampling": false,
    },
    "overview options": {
    },


# Options

## Global options

#### location
The base URL path to add before all system paths.

By default, at root, i.e. `"/"`.

#### base encoding
The base ASP encoding that will be augmented with other atoms and shows described by the other options.

#### shows
List of atoms (or a string containing one atom and its arity) to `#show`, meaning those that will be shown in the output page.

#### engine
Future option that will allow to use other flavors of ASP, or other languages.
Currently, the only valid value is not set, or `ASP/clingo`.

#### compilation

Must be one of `direct access`, `specific access`.

With `direct access`, the compilation of the models is performed each time the `/results` page is loaded, before the loading.

With `specific access`, the compilation of the models is performed each time the `/compilation` page is loaded.

#### generated pages
A list of string being the pages to be generated.
Defaults to all pages, meaning: `["user", "overview", "compilation", "configuration"]`.

#### public pages
A list of string being the pages to be shown in the main page. If a page is shown but not generated, an error should be raised at website compilation.

Defaults to None, meaning equivalence with `generated page` option.

#### raise warnings
Defaults to *true*. If *false*, doesn't indicate possible discrepancies in the configuration file at website-compilation time.

#### raise errors
Defaults to *true*. If *false*, doesn't fail on malformed configuration file at website-compilation time.

#### template
The template name to use. Must be a directory in `templates/` dir, containing the template html files.


## Users options

#### type
Must be one of `restricted`, `valid-id` or `convertible`.

With restricted, `allowed users` field is expected to be a dict or list.

With `valid-id`, `allowed users` field is expected to be none or empty.

With `convertible`, `allowed users` field is expected to be a pure python function taking the user string as input, and returning its uid.


#### allowed
Must be a dict, linking human representation of user uid to its (unique) ASP representation,
or a list, when human and ASP representations are equivalent for all choices.

If the user type is not restricted, that option is to be left blank or non-provided.



## Choices options

#### default
By default, the user is generated with these combinations.

May be "all", none, empty list, or a list of choices (if choice type allows for many choices to be made).

If the given default choice is not compatible with the choice type (e.g. a list for a single choice), errors will be raised.

#### type

May be one of `single`, `multiple`, `at least 1`, `at least <N>` (with N an integer > 0), `at most <K>` (with `K` an integer > 1), or `<N> to <K>`.

Obviously, `1 to 1` is equivalent to `single`.
Finally, `0 or 1` is a valid, more explicit alias to `at most 1`.



#### choices
Must be a dict, linking human representation of choice to its (unique) ASP representation,
or a list, when human and ASP representations are equivalent for all choices.


#### produced atoms
These atoms are produced for each user, depending of made choices.

#### data atoms
Data atoms are other atoms produced from the input and choices, but, in opposition to produced atoms, they are all produced, at website compilation time, from all possible `{user}` and `{choice}` values.

They are useful to specify the user and choices entities only once, in the configuration, without having to write them explicitely in the base encoding.


## Output options

#### max models
Integer, zero or more, describing the maximal number of models the output page will show.
If set to zero, there is no limit to the number of models shown on output page.

See `model selection` option for controlling which models are shown.

#### model selection
This options only takes effect when the total number of models exceed the max limit set by `max models` option.

if this option is set to `first`, #`max models` models output by the solver are taken (with clingo, it's implemented by sending the `-n N` option).

if this option is set to `sampling`, #`max models` models are randomly drafted from the set of all models.

#### model repr
This option allows to control how each model is rendered on the output page.

Legal values and their meaning:

- `"raw"`: models will be shown as ASP atoms.
- `"table/2"`: atoms are expected to be of arity 2, and showing a relation between two sets. A table will be shown.

#### insatisfiability message
Defaults to "*that program is unsatisfiable*".


## Overview options
The overview page indicates all current selected data.

#### public
Default to *true*. If *false*, the overview page URL is not indicated in main page.

#### type
Type(s) of overview. Possible values are: `raw`, `table`.

Multiple may be given, as a list.

Default to `raw` and `table`.


## Configuration options
This json data is the configuration itself.

No option for the moment.


## Main page options

#### title
String that will be set as h1 title in the main page.

#### description
String going just under the title, and before all technical links.


# ROADMAP

### Basic features
- [x] configuration is loaded from file, and default values are added if necessary
- [ ] add options in the config
    - [ ] support of numbered choice types
    - [ ] support it in the UI too: https://www.plus2net.com/javascript_tutorial/checkbox-limit.php
    - [x] support for sampling
- [x] don't recompile the models if nothing changed
- [x] website is running and all pages are accessible
- [x] show a working website, with working forms
- [x] working example use case
- [x] table representation of rel/2-types models
- [x] have `templates/` dir, where multiple templates can live. Allow each configuration file to specify the template to use
- [x] examples
    - [x] choose your character, a simple one-to-one pairing with binary preferences.

### doable in less than a day

- [ ] doc for newcomers
- [ ] doc for non technical users
- [ ] in restricted user mode, allow to only provide user names. Uid can be decided internally. Same goes for choices.
- [ ] allow for saving current sever state, so it can be stopped and restarted without data loss
- [ ] implement other choices types
    - [ ] `ranking`, an order of proposition
    - [ ] `majority judgment`, an independant ranking of propositions (many proposition may have the same rank)
- [ ] support for python instead of ASP
    - [ ] function taking atoms (in json format?) as input, yielding atoms (in json format?) as output
    - [ ] function taking atoms (in json format?) as input, yielding html representation
- [ ] plugin system for `asp models -> html repr`
- [ ] examples
    - [ ] choose your character, a one-to-one pairing with ranked preferences.
    - [ ] restaurant choice based on ranks  (majority judgment demo)
- [ ] multiservice: enable one app to run many configurations.

### Needs a good amount of work
- [ ] multiple choices scheme: users may have to prodive multiple informations for a single service to behave correctly. This needs a complete rethink of how to handle forms and output atoms.
    - [ ] a first approach: choice become in json config a __list__ of choices, asked one by one to the user.

- [ ] allow a model to be debuggable (automatically) with SPOCK method
    - [ ] when unsatisfiable, propose *degraded* models where one (randomly chosen) constraint is ignored.

- [ ] plugin system for other parts of the soft ? forms maybe ?

- [ ] when multiple metrics are used, show the solutions in a pareto front.
    - [ ] 2D: https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~JoostvDoorn/79.embed
    - [ ] 3D: https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~dlindmark/139.embed

- [ ] examples
    - [ ] carpooling for lunch (multiple cars, multiple restaurants, each human has its preferences of restaurants, not all have a car, trying to minimize the number of used car -> may need an exploration of paretto front)
    - [ ] placement of peoples for dinner (needs complex forms)
